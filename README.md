# A color theme for Visual Studio Code using pywal


# How to install the theme

1. install pywal
2. `git clone https://github.com/Bluedrack28/vscode-wal.git ~/.vscode/extensions/` or `git clone https://github.com/Bluedrack28/vscode-wal.git ~/.vscode-insider/extensions/` if you use code-insider like me ^^
3. in the repository `cp templates/color-vscode-theme.json ~/.config/wal/templates/`
4. make a link between the wal template and the extension `ln -s ~/.cache/wal/colors-vscode-theme.json themes/vs-wal-color-theme.json`
5. normally run `wal -R` and the theme will work on vscode
