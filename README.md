# **HELP ME !**

I do not have enough time to devote to this project. I need your help. If you have a little bit of time and a little programming skill. If so, you can gladly make a pull request.
You can find the documentation of the vscode theme [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/theme-color-reference).
Or you can also share this project to other fan of pywal who maybe want to do something for the community. 
Thank you very much.
